# PDP-11 C Emulator (Development Journal)

This project documents the development process of a PDP-11 **emulator** in C.  
The project aims to emulate the behavior of the PDP-11 computer's hardware using the **C programming language**, starting with the basics and progressing through various stages of development. It also includes an **interpreter** for a subset of the PDP-11 machine instructions, allowing step-by-step execution of PDP-11 programs.  
This project is inspired by T.N. Derbysheva's course (2020), taught at the Department of Computer Science and Computational Mathematics of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).
